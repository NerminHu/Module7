For this project, we analyzed the Video Games Sales Data.CSV dataset by loading it into HDInsight using Hive. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from the data using transformation tools such as calculating averages, minimums, and maximums. After aggregating the data, we utilized the Excel tool to create visualizations for further analysis. By performing these steps, we gained valuable insights into the sales performance of video games, identifying trends and patterns that can inform business decisions. The project's directory structure included the raw data file, Hive queries for data extraction, and Excel files containing the visualizations. This organized approach allowed us to efficiently manage and present the results of our analysis.
