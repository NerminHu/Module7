aggregate the data for extracting insights using the following command:
    table showing the average critic score for Sports games:
  
      CREATE TABLE sports_critic_scores AS
      SELECT AVG(critic_score) AS sports_critic_score
      FROM video_game_sales
      WHERE genre = 'Sports';
      
      table showing the average critic score for Shooter games:
      
      CREATE TABLE shooter_critic_scores AS
      SELECT AVG(critic_score) AS shooter_critic_score
      FROM video_game_sales
      WHERE genre = 'Shooter';
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      Create 3 statistics tables:
      
      table showing all games:
      
      CREATE TABLE all_games_statistics AS
      SELECT AVG(global_sales) AS average_global_sales,
         MIN(global_sales) AS min_global_sales,
         MAX(global_sales) AS max_global_sales
      FROM video_game_sales;
      
      table showing Sports games:
      CREATE TABLE sports_games_statistics AS
      SELECT AVG(global_sales) AS average_global_sales,
             MIN(global_sales) AS min_global_sales,
             MAX(global_sales) AS max_global_sales
      FROM video_game_sales
      WHERE genre = 'Sports';
      
       table showing Shooter games:
      CREATE TABLE shooter_games_statistics AS
      SELECT AVG(global_sales) AS average_global_sales,
             MIN(global_sales) AS min_global_sales,
             MAX(global_sales) AS max_global_sales
      FROM video_game_sales
      WHERE genre = 'Shooter';
      -------------------------------------------------------
      
      Create two tables to store the global sales and count of games with that global sales for Sports games and Shooter games.
          Name the columns as "global_sales" and "count"
      
      table showing Sports games:
      CREATE TABLE sports_games_sales_count AS
      SELECT global_sales, COUNT(*) AS count
      FROM video_game_sales
      WHERE genre = 'Sports'
      GROUP BY global_sales;
      
      
      table showing Shooter games:
      CREATE TABLE shooter_games_sales_count AS
      SELECT global_sales, COUNT(*) AS count
      FROM video_game_sales
      WHERE genre = 'Shooter'
      GROUP BY global_sales;
